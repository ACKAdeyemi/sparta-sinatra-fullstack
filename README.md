<hr>

#### Task:

To use what I was taught in the Sinatra Models Intro a to create a SQL database, populate the table and create a website that is able to make requests to and from the database using the 7 RESTful routes. This taks is similar to [Sinatra Models Homework](https://github.com/ACKAdeyemi/sparta-sinatra-models-homework) however this task includes the use of scss to style the website and multiple resources.

This task makes use of:

* Sinatra DSL (a Domain Specific Language that allows us to setup RESTful routes)
* ERB (Embedded Ruby to combine HTML and Ruby)
* SQL (Structured Query Language for database interaction)
* Postgres (an ORDBMS to create the database)
* SCSS (Sassy CSS)
