#### Task:

To use what I was taught in the Sinatra Models Intro a to create a SQL database, populate the table and create a website that is able to make requests to and from the database using the 7 RESTful routes. This task is similar to [Sinatra Models Homework](https://github.com/ACKAdeyemi/sparta-sinatra-models-homework) however this task includes the use of scss to style the website and multiple resources.

This task makes use of:

* Sinatra DSL (a Domain Specific Language that allows us to setup RESTful routes)
* ERB (Embedded Ruby to combine HTML and Ruby)
* SQL (Structured Query Language for database interaction)
* Postgres (an ORDBMS to create the database)
* SCSS (Sassy CSS)

* [W3Schools Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)

#### Challenges:

It wasn't as straightforward (as I'd hoped) to style the pages, as I had to make many considerations before attempting anything. For example, if I wanted to add an element to the 'navbar' (Navigation Bar), I had to consider that this element would be added to every page as the navbar is part of the layout for every page. This would definitely help with consistency however it can come across drab and plain if not done well.

#### Summary:

I'm pretty comfortable at this point with using ERB, MVCs, RESTful routes, etc. and I'm looking forward to applying these concepts to future projects.
